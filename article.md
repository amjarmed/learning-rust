## 5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Learning Rust

### 1. Prerequisite Knowledge

Before diving into Rust, it’s crucial to understand its low-level nature, especially its memory management capabilities. Rust emphasizes managing memory manually, so grasping certain computer science (CS) fundamentals is incredibly helpful. Key topics include:

- **Memory Regions:** Familiarize yourself with stack, heap, and static memory and their respective uses.
- **Memory Management:** Understand how memory allocation and deallocation work, as well as the difference between manual memory management and garbage collection.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Rust’s concurrency features require knowledge of multithreading, synchronization, and parallel processing.
- **Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages:** Knowing these distinctions aids in understanding Rust’s compile-time checks.
- **OOP and Functional Programming Basics:** Rust incorporates elements from both paradigms, so understanding them provides a helpful foundation.

Rust’s strict compile-time checks make knowledge of these topics essential, especially since Rust’s error messages often involve these concepts. Additionally, experience in languages like C or C++ helps, particularly in areas such as pointers, smart pointers, RAII patterns, and memory safety. Rust builds on these languages' foundations, solving key problems in memory safety, concurrency, and error handling.

### 2. Finding the Right Learning Resources

With its unique syntax and features, Rust can feel daunting. Here are recommended resources to smooth the learning journey:

- **Harvard’s CS50 Course:** Available on YouTube, this free course provides a strong foundation in CS fundamentals.
- **Memory Management Videos:** Many playlists cover memory management essentials, which are key for Rust developers.
- **C and C++ Fundamentals:** The Cherno on YouTube provides in-depth tutorials on C++ essentials.

For Rust-specific content:

- **The Rust Book:** An official, comprehensive introduction to Rust.
- **Rustlings GitHub Repo:** Practice exercises to build foundational Rust skills.
- **Crust of Rust Series by Jon Gjengset:** In-depth, advanced topics for when you’re ready for deep dives.
- **Zero to Prod in Rust:** This book not only guides you in building server-side Rust projects but also focuses on production-ready code.

For different applications of Rust, check out resources like the **Embedded Rust Book** (embedded systems), **WebAssembly Rust Book** (WebAssembly), and **Jeremy Chon's Axum course** for server-side programming.

### 3. Expect a Slowdown in Productivity

Rust is a language that prioritizes safety and performance over development speed. Coming from languages like JavaScript or Python, where quick prototyping is common, Rust can feel slow. The language’s strict type system and compile-time checks require thoughtful code structuring and memory management.

Rust's compiler enforces a high standard for safety, meaning syntax and memory management rules are strict. Initially, productivity may slow down, especially as you learn Rust’s advanced memory management and type-safety features. However, this initial investment in understanding Rust pays off in long-term maintainability and runtime efficiency.

### 4. Rust Will Make You a Better Developer

Rust challenges developers to write clear, efficient, and memory-safe code, often improving their skills in the process. Here’s how Rust contributes to your growth:

- **Focus on Memory Safety:** Rust’s ownership model teaches developers to manage memory explicitly and prevent common bugs.
- **Error Handling:** Using Rust’s `Result` type encourages developers to handle errors safely and deliberately, reducing runtime exceptions.
- **Concurrency Made Easier:** Rust has built-in support for concurrency, offering developers safe abstractions for parallel and asynchronous programming.

Through Rust’s strict compiler and memory-safe abstractions, developers learn disciplined, efficient coding practices that apply across languages.

### 5. Join the Rust Community

Rust has one of the most welcoming developer communities, so be sure to participate. The Rust forums, Rustaceans on Reddit, and Rust user groups worldwide can help you solve challenges and learn best practices. Engaging with the community not only enriches your understanding but also exposes you to diverse Rust applications.

### In Summary

Rust’s learning curve is steep, but with the right CS fundamentals, carefully chosen resources, patience with the productivity slowdown, and community engagement, the journey becomes immensely rewarding. Rust’s focus on safety, performance, and concurrency will not only expand your technical skillset but also reshape your approach to programming.
